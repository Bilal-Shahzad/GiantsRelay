      <h2>Week 7 Recap</h2>
      <p>
      In a crucial game, the New York Giants managed to break a four-game losing streak and secure a 14-7 victory against the Washington Commanders. The win was a testament to their commitment to playing complementary football, where all facets of the game - offense, defense, and special teams - made significant contributions.
</p>

<p>
Despite facing multiple challenges, including a makeshift offensive line, the Giants put together a commendable performance. Their offensive line featured several new additions, including tackles Justin Pugh and Tyre Phillips, a first-time left guard in Marcus McKethan, and a center in Ben Bredeson who typically plays guard. Mark Glowinski, who lost his starting role after the season opener, returned to the lineup as right guard. Notably, key offensive linemen like Andrew Thomas, Evan Neal, and center John Michael Schmitz were inactive due to injuries. Despite these obstacles, the linemen showed professionalism and determination to help backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor perform effectively.
</p>

<p>
Tyrod Taylor, filling in for the injured Daniel Jones, delivered a solid performance, throwing for 279 yards and two touchdowns. His two touchdown passes were caught by Darren Waller and Saquon Barkley, the latter of which turned into a 32-yard scoring play, with Barkley showcasing his ability to gain extra yardage after the catch. The touchdown to Waller was not only a significant moment for the Giants but also marked Waller's first touchdown with the team and the offense's first in over three games.
</p>

<p>
Saquon Barkley was a standout player for the Giants, leading the team in rushing with 77 yards. Waller's seven receptions for 98 yards further bolstered the offense.
</p>

<p>
On the defensive front, the Giants were nothing short of exceptional. They limited the Commanders to just 76 rushing yards, allowed only one third-down conversion in 15 attempts, and recorded six sacks on quarterback Sam Howell. Rookie cornerback Deonte Banks contributed with his first career interception and a crucial tackle on Washington's wide receiver Terry McLaurin. Linebacker Bobby Okereke emerged as the team's leading tackler for the fourth consecutive game.
</p>

<p>
The special teams made a significant impact when lineman Leonard Williams blocked a field goal attempt by the Commanders. This marked the Giants' first blocked field goal since 2017 and the first of Williams' career. However, special teams also contributed to some tension in the game, as Graham Gano missed a 42-yard field goal attempt, and Sterling Shepard's muffed punt return led to a turnover.
</p>

<p>
While the Giants had control for most of the game, two critical second-half turnovers allowed the Commanders to make the final moments more nail-biting than expected. The Commanders capitalized on one of these turnovers to score their only touchdown of the game.
</p>

<p>
In the end, the Giants managed to secure the win, improving their record to 2-5. The victory was a collective effort, emphasizing the importance of playing complementary football and supporting each other. They look to build on this success in the upcoming game against the New York Jets, with the hope of continuing to play with the same level of teamwork and determination that characterized their win against the Washington Commanders.
