        The game started off pretty bad against the Cardinals. In a game they
        were expected to dominate against themselves against the Cardinals,
        they found themselves down 21. But at halftime a light sparked within
        them and they started playing like a team. Rallying to the ball getting
        stops on defense and offense, making connections, getting good runs and
        the Giants come out victorious 31-28.
