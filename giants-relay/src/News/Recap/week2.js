      <p>The game started off pretty bad against the Cardianls. In a game they were expected to dominate against themselves against the cardinals, they found themselves down 21. But at halftime a light sparked within them and they started playing like a team. Rallying to the ball getting stops on defense and and offense, making connections, getting good runs and the Giants come out victorious 31-28.</p>
