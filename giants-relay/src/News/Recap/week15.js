      <h2>Week 15 Recap</h2>
      <p>
      The New York Giants' three-game winning streak came to an end as they fell to the New Orleans Saints, bringing their record to 5-9 for the season. Despite the loss, the Giants remain mathematically alive in the NFC playoff race with three games remaining. Their next challenge awaits them on Christmas afternoon in Philadelphia.
</p>

<p>
The defeat ensures that the Giants will finish the season with a sub-.500 record. The game featured an unusual sight as punter Jamie Gillan stepped in to kick a 40-yard field goal for the Giants' final points as time expired in the second quarter. This was Gillan's first field goal and the second attempt of his five-year career, with return specialist Gunner Olszewski serving as the emergency holder after Randy Bullock's injury on the kickoff following his 56-yard field goal in the first quarter.

<p>
The Giants faced offensive challenges throughout the game, finishing with only 193 yards of total offense (60 rushing, 133 passing). Tommy DeVito, sacked seven times for a loss of 57 yards, encountered difficulties after a sack-free victory against Green Bay the previous week. The team converted only two third downs on 16 attempts, contributing to the offensive struggles.
</p>

<p>
Despite the offensive hurdles, the game marked a notable defensive effort as neither team committed a turnover. This was the first time in a Giants game since their NFC Wild Card Game victory in Minnesota last January and the first time in the regular season since October 9, 2022, against Green Bay.
</p>

<p>
Saquon Barkley, aiming for 1,000 yards from scrimmage for the fourth time in his career, fell short, rushing for a season-low 14 yards on nine carries and gaining 23 yards on two receptions. The Giants now look ahead to their next matchup in Philadelphia with the playoff race still within mathematical reach.
