      <h2>Week 4 Recap</h2>
      <p>
      The New York Giants, who surprised many with a successful 2022 NFL season under the leadership of first-year coach Brian Daboll, are experiencing a huge contrast in 2023. After breaking a streak of five consecutive losing seasons and making it to the playoffs last year, expectations were high for the Giants this season. However, their recent 24-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks at MetLife Stadium reflects a disappointing start with a 1-3 record.</p>

<p>
One of the major challenges the Giants faced in this game was their struggling pass protection. The absence of All-Pro left tackle Andrew Thomas, who has been sidelined with a hamstring injury, and other injuries to the offensive line led to quarterback Daniel Jones being under constant pressure. The Seahawks capitalized on this, recording a franchise-record 11 sacks, and Jones faced 14 hits throughout the game. Despite completing an impressive 79.4% of his passes, Jones threw two interceptions, lost a fumble resulting in a Seattle touchdown, and failed to lead the Giants into the end zone.

Coach Daboll acknowledges the team's poor performance, emphasizing the need to do better in both playing and coaching. He expresses confidence in the players and coaches but acknowledges the team's shortcomings, particularly in pass protection. The offensive line, already affected by injuries, may need restructuring to address the protection breakdowns.
</p>

<p>
On a positive note, the defense showed promise, limiting the Seahawks to 281 total yards, 13 first downs, and converting just three of 12 third-down opportunities. However, issues with special teams and the inability to score on offense remain concerns.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward, the Giants face upcoming games against AFC East co-leaders Miami and Buffalo, both with 3-1 records. Daboll remains optimistic about the team's potential for improvement and emphasizes the long season ahead. Players, while acknowledging the shock of their current situation, emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes and focusing on correcting issues to play better football in the remainder of the season. Overall, the Giants face a challenging period of self-assessment and adjustment as they strive to meet the high expectations set after their successful 2022 season.
