      <h2>Week 10 Recap</h2>
      <p>
      In summary, the Giants faced a challenging 30-6 loss to the Raiders, with quarterback Daniel Jones suffering a knee injury in the first half. The interim head coach, former Giants linebacker Antonio Pierce, led the Raiders to improve their record to 4-5, while the Giants fell to 2-7 for the season. Despite some reinforcements, including Jones' return from a neck injury and the activation of key offensive players, the Giants struggled as injuries continued to impact their lineup.

Undrafted rookie Tommy DeVito replaced the injured Jones but faced challenges, completing 15 of 20 passes for 176 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. The offensive line saw the return of Andrew Thomas and Evan Neal but faced setbacks with Neal leaving in the fourth quarter due to an ankle injury. Running back Saquon Barkley, who moved into fifth place on the Giants' all-time rushing list, ran for 90 yards on 16 carries.

On the defensive front, the Giants made notable roster moves, including the trade of defensive lineman Leonard Williams to the Seahawks. Linebacker Justin Hollins was elevated from the practice squad, and cornerback Adoree' Jackson suffered a concussion during the game. The Raiders, undergoing coaching changes and shifting to rookie quarterback Aidan O'Connell, managed to score 30 points, breaking a two-game losing streak.
