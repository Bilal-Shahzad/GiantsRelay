        It was a solid effort by the Giants. They were expected to lose big to the 49ers but they held their own. 
        It is hard to beat a team that is expected to go to the Super Bowl when you are missing your star player. 
        Towards the end of the game it just unfolded for the Giants, their offense could not get going and their defense could not get off the field on 3rd down. 
        Hopefully they are able to bounce back against the the Seahawks on MNF against the Seattle Seahawks.
